                    BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum
                    blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to
                    members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board.
                    Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation

        Each Bored Ape is unique and programmatically generated from over 170
        possible traits, including expression, headwear, clothing, and more. All apes
        are dope, but some are rarer than others.

        The apes are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and
        hosted on IPFS. <a href="">(See Record and Proof.)</a> Purchasing an ape costs 0.08 ETH.

        To access members-only areas such as <a href="">THE BATHROOM</a> , Apeholders will
        need to be signed into their Metamask Wallet

    The BAYC Bathroom will become operational once the presale period is over. It
    contains a canvas accessible only to wallets containing at least one ape. Like
    any good dive bar bathroom, this is the place to draw, scrawl, or write
    expletives.
    
    Each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the bathroom wall every fifteen
    minutes. Think of it as a collaborative art experiment for the cryptosphere. A
    members-only canvas for the discerning minds of crypto twitter.
    
    We're pretty sure it's going to be full of dicks.</pre>
